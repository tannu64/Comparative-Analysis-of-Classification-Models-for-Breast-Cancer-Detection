# Comparative Analysis of Classification Models for Breast Cancer Detection

> **Description (350 characters)**  
> This repository demonstrates a complete ML workflow using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. It includes Exploratory Data Analysis, Principal Component Analysis, and classification with SVM, Decision Tree, and Neural Network, analyzing performance metrics and comparing models with/without dimensionality reduction. It presents insights on metrics and highlights PCA's impact.

## Overview
This project applies multiple machine learning models to classify breast tumors as benign or malignant, leveraging both the **original** dataset features and **PCA-transformed** features. It demonstrates:

1. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** to understand feature correlations and distributions.  
2. **Dimensionality Reduction with PCA** to capture ~95% variance with fewer components.  
3. **Model Training** using **SVM**, **Decision Tree**, and **Neural Network (MLP)** with hyperparameter tuning.  
4. **Performance Comparison** through accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and training times.
